# Debugging Scenario

## Question

**Can't Run Tests**

**Category:** Debugging

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

Computer: ROG STRIX

OS: Windows 11

Program: Visual Studio Code

Terminal: Bash

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead.
Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**
